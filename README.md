# Hide LinkedIn Posts

## Abstract
This Chrome extension hides specified posts on LinkedIn.
Currently it only hides celebration posts (promotions, new roles, etc.).

## Tech Stack
This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Setup/Installation
You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`.

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the red linkedin icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see a popup that says "Hide LinkedIn Posts" and links to this repo. From there, you can navigate to the LinkedIn homepage (linkedin.com/feed). As you scroll through your feed you shouldn't see any celebration posts like promotions, new roles, etc.

## Future Changes
Eventually I want to port all of my extensions to Firefox.

If you're interested in hiding a particular type of post, feel free to send me a message or create an issue.
